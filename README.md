# Satis

Simple static Composer repository generator.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/composer/satis.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/composer/satis)
[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/composer/satis/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/composer/satis)


## Run from source

- Install satis: `composer create-project composer/satis:dev-master`
- Build a repository: `php bin/satis build <configuration-file> <output-dir>`

Read the more detailed instructions in the [documentation][].


## Run as Docker container

Pull the image:

``` sh
docker pull composer/satis
```

Run the image (with Composer cache from host):

``` sh
docker run --rm --init -it \
  -u $(id -u):$(id -g) \
  -v $(pwd)/build:/build \
  -v "${COMPOSER_HOME:-$HOME/.composer}:/composer" \
  composer/satis
```

If you want to run the image without implicitly running Satis, you have to
override the entrypoint specified in the `Dockerfile`:

``` sh
--entrypoint /bin/sh
```


## Purge

If you choose to archive packages as part of your build, over time you can be
left with useless files. With the `purge` command, you can delete these files.

``` sh
php bin/satis purge <configuration-file> <output-dir>
```

 > Note: don't do this unless you are certain your projects no longer reference
    any of these archives in their `composer.lock` files.


## Updating

Updating Satis is as simple as running `git pull && composer install` in the
Satis directory.

If you are running Satis as a Docker container, simply pull the latest image.
