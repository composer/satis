# Satis

Simple static Composer repository generator.

## Run from source

Satis requires a recent PHP version, it does not run with unsupported PHP versions. Check the `composer.json` file for details.

-   Install satis: `composer create-project composer/satis:dev-main`
-   Build a repository: `php bin/satis build <configuration-file> <output-directory>`

Read the more detailed instructions in the [documentation][].

## Run as Docker container

Pull the image:

```sh
docker pull composer/satis
```

Run the image (with Composer cache from host):

```sh
docker run --rm --init -it \
  --user $(id -u):$(id -g) \
  --volume $(pwd):/build \
  --volume "${COMPOSER_HOME:-$HOME/.composer}:/composer" \
  composer/satis build <configuration-file> <output-directory>
```

If you want to run the image without implicitly running Satis, you have to
override the entrypoint specified in the `Dockerfile`:

```sh
--entrypoint /bin/sh
```

## Purge

If you choose to archive packages as part of your build, over time you can be
left with useless files. With the `purge` command, you can delete these files.

```sh
php bin/satis purge <configuration-file> <output-dir>
```

> Note: don't do this unless you are certain your projects no longer reference any of these archives in their `composer.lock` files.

## Updating

Updating Satis is as simple as running `git pull && composer install` in the
Satis directory.

If you are running Satis as a Docker container, simply pull the latest image.
